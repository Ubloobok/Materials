# From Shock to Support: Parallels Between Grief and SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

In our mysterious world of software engineering, we can often draw parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts. One such intriguing association is mapping the phases of the [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) to [stages of Grief](https://probablyhealthy.com/seven-stages-of-grief/#what-are-the-7-stages-of-grief) (or a later one, [The Kübler-Ross Change Curve](https://stresslessco.com/blog/changecurve)). Whether this analogy provides useful insights or is simply good fun, it makes for an interesting exploration. So, let’s dive into this humorous journey through the emotional rollercoaster that is software development!

## 1. Shock — Initiation
**Shock: “We have a new project!”**

You can almost see the collective gasp of the team when they hear these words. The initiation phase is like the initial shock of grief. Everyone is stunned, wondering where this new project came from and why it has landed on their desks. It’s the moment when you stare at the project initiation document and think, “Are we really doing this?”

It’s crucial to move past this initial shock quickly. Gathering your thoughts and addressing the team with a clear vision can help. Organize a kick-off meeting to discuss the project’s goals and scope. This meeting can serve as a reality check, transforming shock into a focused mindset. By addressing it, you can prevent hasty decisions that might lead to undesirable outcomes. A clear vision from the outset helps ensure that the project starts on the right foot, aligning everyone’s efforts toward a common goal.

## 2. Denial — Requirements
**Denial: “These requirements can’t be right. Are they even serious?”**

As we move into the requirements gathering phase, denial sets in. The team starts to look through the client’s requests, only to find themselves skeptical. “They can’t possibly need all this,” you mutter. “We must have misunderstood.” The specifications seem so far-fetched that your brain refuses to accept them as reality.

Managing denial is critical to having efficient dialogues. Without these conversations, we can’t fully understand what the business truly needs. It’s essential to engage in discussions early and often, bringing together stakeholders and developers to clarify and validate requirements. A product owner plays an important role here, bridging the gap between the business and the development team. Overcoming denial quickly enables the team to move forward with a well-defined direction.

## 3. Anger — Planning
**Anger: “How on earth are we supposed to do this?!”**

Now, it’s time for planning, and the anger kicks in. You start outlining the project timeline, breaking down tasks, and estimating resources. As the scope of work becomes clear, frustration builds. “Who thought this was a good idea?” you rage internally, or sometimes, not so internally. The size of the task feels overwhelming, and the deadlines seem downright impossible.

Anger helps no one, neither in life nor in our jobs. It’s important to take a step back and approach this stage with a rational mindset. Hold a planning session where the team can collectively identify key deliverables, main milestones and set realistic deadlines. This collaborative approach ensures that everyone is on the same page and that the project is broken down into manageable chunks. By addressing potential challenges early, the team can transform frustration into constructive action.

## 4. Bargaining — Design
**Bargaining**: “Maybe if we tweak the design here, we can save some time…”

As we enter the design phase, the bargaining begins. The team starts to look for shortcuts and compromises. “What if we reuse this component?” “Can we simplify this feature?” The goal is to reduce the workload and make the project more manageable. You negotiate with yourself and others, hoping to find a path that will make the project less daunting and more feasible.

Critical decisions about trade-offs must be made during the design phase. Should we prioritize timelines over scope, or vice versa? Is it better to aim for a working solution now, rather than striving for an ideal one that might delay the project? It’s essential to evaluate the impact of each trade-off carefully, weighing the pros and cons with a clear understanding of the project’s priorities. Take into account explicit and hidden costs. Involving the entire team and stakeholders in these discussions ensures that everyone is aware of the compromises and is on board with the decisions made. This collaborative approach helps in setting realistic expectations and ensures that the design phase moves forward efficiently.

## 5. Depression — Development
**Depression: “This is never going to end…”**

Development can be a long, tough process, and it often leads to feelings of sadness. The initial excitement fades, and the reality of the workload sets in. Bugs appear out of nowhere, deadlines loom, and the end seems nowhere in sight. The team works through the code, feeling stuck in an endless loop, questioning why they ever agreed to this in the first place. For some, the hardest part is realizing that now they have to build everything they’ve planned.

Development might be the longest phase, and it’s understandable why it can feel overwhelming. At the same time, this is where the real fun of engineering can be found. To handle these feelings, it’s important to break the development process into smaller steps. Celebrate small wins and progress, no matter how minor they seem. Regularly reviewing and reflecting on what’s been achieved can help keep up motivation and provide a sense of forward movement.

## 6. Testing — Testing
**Testing: “Will it work this time?”**

Finally, we reach the testing phase, which perfectly matches the “testing” stage of grief. The software is put through its paces, and everyone holds their breath. Each test cycle is a mix of hope and worry as bugs are found and (hopefully) fixed. It’s a critical phase where the team carefully checks the product, hoping the code holds up under pressure.

You’re not just testing the code, but also the results of decisions and efforts from all previous stages. Everything from requirements to design, from planning to development, is examined to make sure it matches the initial vision. This is where the real evaluation happens, and it’s crucial to be thorough. Good test planning, creating detailed test cases, and systematic execution are essential. Preliminary testing in lower environments can shorten the feedback loop and don’t annoy end users with too obvious bugs. Encourage open communication within the team to quickly address any issues that come up. Testing reflects the entire project lifecycle, and a strong approach here ensures that the product is ready for release.

## 7. Acceptance — Release
**Acceptance: “It’s out there now. We’ve done our best.”**

The release phase brings a sense of acceptance. After all the struggles, the product is finally ready to be launched. The team acknowledges that while it might not be perfect, it’s the best they could achieve within the constraints. There’s a sense of relief and satisfaction as the software goes live. You accept that some things might still go wrong, but you’re ready to face whatever comes next.

By the time we reach the release phase, we’ve come to terms with the project as it stands. After thorough testing and many revisions, we accept that the product meets the expectations, or at least aligns with our moral compass. It’s a moment of reflection, where the team recognizes the culmination of their efforts. This phase is not just about launching the product, but also about acknowledging the journey taken to get here. Time to celebrate the achievement and take pride in the work done.

## 8. Integration — Support
**Processing: “Let’s see how it performs in the real world.”**

The support phase, like the final stage of grief, is about processing and moving forward. The team monitors the software in the real world, addressing issues as they arise and learning from the feedback. It’s a continuous cycle of improvement and adaptation, reflecting on the journey and using the experience to inform future projects.

Now that the software is live, it’s time to embrace it as a natural part of your professional life. This phase is where you truly get to see the impact of your work, receiving real-world feedback and continuously improving the product. Support is about more than just fixing bugs; it’s about enhancing the product based on user experiences and ensuring it remains relevant and functional. Accepting this phase as an integral part of the lifecycle allows you to find satisfaction in maintaining and improving the product. Enjoy the process, knowing that your efforts make a tangible difference..

While comparing the Software Development Lifecycle to the stages of Grief might seem crazy, it highlights the emotional journey that software engineers often go through. From the initial shock of a new project to the acceptance and support of a completed product, each phase comes with its own set of challenges and feelings. So, next time you’re feeling annoyed in requirements discussion, or confused in system design, or spending hours in debugging, remember: it’s all part of the process, and you’re not alone in experiencing the highs and lows of software development.

This article does not pretend to cover everything about SDLC, because there are many great books and talks on this subject. As before, except of fun, here is one essential outcome. Despite all the abstractness and coolness of Tech-industry, we are able to adapt and reuse an experience accumulated in other scientific fields, and it’s worth it.

Thanks for your time, hope it was useful and funny in the right way.
